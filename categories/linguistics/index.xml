      <description>In this work, the European, Brazilian, Cape Verdean varieties of Portuguese were studied in comparison between them and with Italian, with a focus on the null subject parameter (NSP).
Beside the big number of studies on the latter, its nature is not completely clear, as so for concurrent properties and activation factors.
The work is therefore a paper to study the micro variation over proximate languages.
Â The generative theory base itself in the idea of a Universal Grammar (UG) thanks to children are able to learn languages.</description>

      <description>The ambition to create artificial beings, able to act as humans do, has always been in our fantasy. Computer Science is defined as the discipline that deals with the collection and process of information (De Mauro, 2000), and since linguistics handle the analysis and study of the most powerful tool humans have to express information (i. e. language), their combination was unavoidable.
The possibility to build machines able to produce language is based on the existence of a model, that can either be different from the one used by humans or can shed a light on it.</description>
