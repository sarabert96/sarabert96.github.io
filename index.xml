      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;short-version&#34;&gt;Short version&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a degree in IT and a Bachelor in languages, I am currently focusing on computational linguistics in a Master degree. For this reason, my skills are both practical and theoretical, namely programming, speaking other languages and use technology in everyday life. I also enjoy photography and therefore I learned by myself the basics of photo editing and I practice juggling in my spare time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;long-version&#34;&gt;Long version&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was born the day 7 February 1996 in northern Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up I developed interest in technologies and in languages, so in my High School I choose the Information Technology career at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itiszuccante.edu.it/&#34;&gt;C. Zuccante institute&lt;/a&gt;, getting the diploma in 2015. After that, I decided to persue the passion for languages enrolling at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unive.it/&#34;&gt;Ca&amp;rsquo; Foscari University of Venice&lt;/a&gt; to study Portuguese and Spanish, obtaining the degree in 2018. During my Bachelor I discovered the field of Linguistics, and I got extremely fascinated by that: I had no idea that there was a scientific way to study languages, actually, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that there was science behind languages at all! But suddently, things got even better: thanks to some friends&amp;rsquo; advices the area of computational linguistics came up, offering the chance to join my previous knowledge and interest for technologies with my new discovery. So here I am! Currently enrolled at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unipi.it/&#34;&gt;University of Pisa&lt;/a&gt; to study a &lt;a href=&#34;https://infouma.fileli.unipi.it/&#34;&gt;Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Digital Humanities&lt;/a&gt; where I&amp;rsquo;m trying to specialize in computational linguistics doing exams such as Machine Learning, Human Language Technologies, Data Mining, Applied Linguistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the ability to use the personal computer to pursue my necessities, but I won&amp;rsquo;t lie, the majority of times the only thing I do is search a youtube tutorial regarding what I need! But after all, that&amp;rsquo;s what this age gives us: the possibility to learn stuff by yourself and help each other&amp;hellip;My tought is, if somebody was able to do that, I can be able too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beside that, I am also a juggler in my &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do&amp;rdquo; moments and I like photography, but I never studied in detail these two things. Maybe, one day&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
